        <body>
        Bowen Chen, I am majoring in advertising, interested in media planning and analyzing data. I know how to use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe premiere Pro, and Adobe Illustrator; I also have some basic skills in Python coding. I am really into music outside of work; I play the trombone and listen to hip-hop music. I am always desperate to expand my experiences by challenging myself and learning new things.
